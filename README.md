## ðŸŽ¯ Project Context

This app was built as part of a Flutter animation-focused assignment during a hiring process.  
It demonstrates smooth animated transitions, form validation, and clean state handling using Bloc â€” all implemented without relying on external libraries.

The app itself was well-received and stands as a solid demonstration of my skills in Flutter UI/UX architecture and animation.
